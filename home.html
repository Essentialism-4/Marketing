        <h2>What Is Essentialism?</h2>
        <div>
        <p>Essentialism is a way to contribute more by keeping track of what
            is most essential in your everyday life. Essentialism will help keep 
            you making progress on all of your personal and work related needs.

        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Essentialism will take your values and help you compare them
                to your current projects to help you realize what is most 
                essential. You choose from the given choices what your values are
                and then the projects you are working on and we will do the rest.
                We will show your values and projects side by side so you can 
                prioritize what is most essential!</p>

        <h2>Why Essentialism?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>In a world with everything shouting for your attention,
                the disciplined pursuit of less has never been more 
                needed. Enter Essentialism. The Way of the Essentialist 
                involves doing less, but better, so you can make the 
                highest possible contribution. It’s not about getting 
                more done in less time or getting less done. It’s about 
                getting only the right things done. It’s about regaining 
                control of our own choices about where to spend our time 
                and energies instead of giving others implicit permission to 
                choose for us. The first step to essentialism is identifying 
                your values.</p>
