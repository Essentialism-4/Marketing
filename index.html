            Lambda Role: Web26 team lead / Labs student<br>
            Coding Background: I always loved the hardware aspect of PC building, as 
            well as staying up to date on the cutting edge of tech, so coding 
            on the software side was a natural progression. What I love about 
            coding is that it's a constantly evolving field with lots to learn, 
            and plenty of job opportunities.</p>
